                <p id="text">
                    Reasons for pursuing this degree: LOL, I have a long story to say.
                    Alright, my journey to studying Computer Science is the definition of chaos. Think plot twists, emotional breakdowns, and a little bit of double-agent action.

                    <br><br>So, it all started with me being Dr. Ahmed. My family had already decided I‚Äôd be a doctor. ‚ÄúDr. Ahmed, the pride of the family!‚Äù They didn‚Äôt just give me the title, they gave me the whole identity. I hadn‚Äôt even started med school yet, and I was already their golden child. But here‚Äôs where things get interesting.

                    <span id="moreText" style="display: none;"> <br><br>During a family vacation in Egypt, I had my big decision moment. Everyone packed their bags to head back to the UAE, except me. My papers were registered at a med school in Cairo, my flight to the UAE was booked, but I wasn‚Äôt planning to take it. I was fully set to cancel it just a few hours before departure. Then, the drama began. My mom sat me down in full emotional mode, tears everywhere. ‚ÄúAhmed, how could you leave us? How will we survive without you?‚Äù And me, trying to stay calm, said, ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE the ones leaving me here!‚Äù But seeing her cry broke me. Four hours before the flight, I packed my bags and flew back to the UAE, officially leaving Dr. Ahmed behind.

                        <br><br>Now, I was back in the UAE, still confused about my future. That‚Äôs when I registered at AUS for Architecture CAAD. It seemed like a solid plan until my dad‚Äôs friend called me. And let me tell you, he did not hold back. He basically said, ‚ÄúAhmed, don‚Äôt. Just don‚Äôt. Run as far away from CAAD as you can. Do anything else, literally anything. Maybe Computer Science?‚Äù And I thought, ‚ÄúFine, whatever.‚Äù So, I changed my major to Computer Science before the semester even started.
                        
                        <br><br>Here‚Äôs where things get hilarious. For two whole weeks, I was living a double life. Since everything at AUS was online because of COVID, I was attending Computer Science classes there while ALSO attending Marine Engineering classes on-campus somewhere else. I‚Äôd sit in marine engineering lectures, looking like I belonged, but in the back of my mind, I knew I had one foot out the door. At first, I thought marine engineering was cool. I loved the hands-on activities and the energy of the campus. But then reality hit: I‚Äôd have to live on a ship for six months at a time, away from family, friends, and, well, life. That wasn‚Äôt for me. So, after two weeks, I fully committed to Computer Science.
                        
                        <br><br>And that‚Äôs how I ended up here. No more Dr. Ahmed, no more ships, no more CAAD. Just Ahmed, the Computer Science student who made it through a series of questionable decisions. And honestly? I don‚Äôt regret a thing.

                    I‚Äôm someone who thrives on both mental and physical challenges. My journey started on the football field, where I played at a competitive level for both a club and my university team‚Äîuntil injuries and a busy schedule led me to explore new passions. Now, I channel that same competitive spirit into Jiu-Jitsu, gym workouts, and table tennis, always striving to push my limits.
                    
                    <br><br>Beyond sports, I‚Äôm deeply immersed in technology and coding, constantly building and learning‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs web development, cybersecurity, or machine learning. But my creativity doesn‚Äôt stop there. I have a passion for photography, videography, and video editing, capturing stories through visuals, whether it‚Äôs travel moments or meaningful content. At the same time, I find inspiration in books, Arabic poetry, and storytelling, appreciating the power of words and artistic expression. Whether I‚Äôm competing, creating, or coding, I‚Äôm always on a journey of growth, pushing myself to explore new horizons</p>

This brought me to engineering where I am constantly challenged to solve problems and I find myself challenging the professor's way of doing things. As for why I chose computer engineering specifically, I will be honest, I just wanted to jump on the bandawagon hahah.</p>
